1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,839
few ideas can polarize like socialism
many see it as the path to Freedom manu

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,040
others see it as the path to tyranny
this video won't pick sides in that

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,400
debate we're only here to answer the
question what is it what is

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,240
socialism many would say that the answer
is simple and they'd open a dictionary

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,119
and read a definition about socialism
being the government owning the means of

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,759
production and directing the economy
that's definitely a significant

7
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,200
understanding of socialism but the
problem is it's tied to a certain era

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,600
and many if not most of modern
socialists don't go by it so we're going

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,200
to need something broader but then if
you ask those socialists what they think

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,719
socialism is their answer is often
unusably broad like saying socialism is

11
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,000
the Hope for human freedom and justice
under the unprecedented conditions of

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,239
life that Humanity will face in the 21st
century so by that pretty much anyone

13
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,079
can be a socialist this is the point
where people usually do a lot of hening

14
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,400
about how difficult it is to nail down a
specific conception of socialism I

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,840
frankly don't think it's that bad I
think the best way to do this is to go

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,799
through socialism chronologically show
where the ideas came from where they

17
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,240
converged and where they split and where
that leaves us today so most of this

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,240
video is basically going to be a history
of socialist thought I think it'll help

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,240
to start with some general comments the
first thing to say is that socialism as

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,680
a political tradition emerged as a
reaction against liberalism specifically

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,200
as a reaction against the Industrial
Revolution as liberalism grew in

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,680
popularity and in influence socialism
grew along with it so the histories of

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,799
liberalism and socialism are intertwined
and you can even think of liberalism as

24
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,600
a parent ideology of socialism
liberalism can be understood as the

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,479
political philosophy where individuals
are held to be ends in themselves

26
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,479
liberals want to create a political
order where people can develop into

27
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,799
whoever they want to be they can think
whatever they want to think believe

28
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,920
believe whatever they want to believe
and pursue whatever they want to pursue

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,799
liberals primarily achieve that through
law notably by granting people rights

30
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,239
those rights are designed to keep people
from suppressing each other's

31
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,360
individuality liberalism expressed as an
economic philosophy is capitalism so

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,360
that's when you have property rights
backed by law and at least theoretically

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,120
a free market where people are free to
exchange goods and services with others

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,319
in a liberal order hierarchies naturally
develop and socialists traditionally

35
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,680
concern themselves with negative effects
related to those hierarchies Liberals

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,959
are traditionally concerned with
concentrations of political power so

37
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,280
they don't want a king to have all the
power they don't want a minority to have

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,800
all the power and they don't want a
majority to have all the power so they

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
want Power broken up across Society
socialists are traditionally concerned

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,760
with concentrations of economic power
typically the power that the rich are

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,959
thought to hold over the poor so
socialists typically want their own

42
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,200
checks and Balan
against concentrations of economic power

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,680
the Socialist ethic aspires towards
equalitarianism which can also be called

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,959
egalitarianism but I think
equalitarianism is a word that's a

45
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,080
little bit easier to intuitively grasp
what exactly that means depends on the

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,720
Socialist it could mean that people
should get equal portions of things or

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,319
it could mean that people in some other
way should be treated equally or it

48
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,080
could just mean the general belief that
human beings have fundamentally equal

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,280
Worth or moral status so the concept of
equality is very important in socialism

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,799
socialists tend to be motivated by a
sense of Injustice they tend to look to

51
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,439
the worst off the needy the sick the
unfortunate or the oppressed and claim

52
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,799
that their circumstances are unnecessary
and even unfair people typically point

53
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,799
to three founding influences of
socialism s Simone Charles Fier and

54
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,920
Robert Owen what they all had in common
was a sense of the inadequacy of of

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,239
unadulterated liberalism which is to say
unregulated capitalism they didn't call

56
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,280
themselves socialists because the word
socialism wasn't around yet but you can

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,640
see something recognizably socialist in
their work for example when s Simone

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,160
looked around 18th century France he
said here is an idea that seems right to

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,600
me the first needs of Life are the most
urgent ones those without property can

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,919
only satisfy them in an incomplete
manner a physiologist sees clearly that

61
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,320
their most constant desire should be
that of lowering their taxes or

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,199
increasing in their pay which amounts to
the same thing s Simone called for the

63
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,639
creation of a new Christianity founded
on the principle that all men must

64
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,240
behave as brothers toward one another
and whose overall goal was the most

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,280
rapid possible amelioration of the
condition of the poorest class he also

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,520
advocated for collectively agreeing on
rewarding those who succeed in doing

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,880
works of General utility for example by
rewarding in the artists who fill the

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
gaps in your busy life with the
pleasures which are best suited to

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,280
develop your intelligence in other words
he's saying that if we let things freely

70
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,280
develop negative side effects come along
with that and he's arguing that we

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,840
should instead intentionally shape
things according to our values going

72
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,880
forward that's going to be a running
theme in socialism Charles Fier looked

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,720
at capitalist societies and argued that
they weren't organized efficiently he

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,919
thought immense advantages would result
if people were brought together to work

75
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,280
communally he said why are there 300
wineries competing against each other

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,960
most of them in disrepair when there
could be one great wiery why would a 100

77
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,919
milkmaids go to the neighboring City to
get a 100 jugs of milk when one milkid

78
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,720
could go get a barrel of milk for
everybody so if we did these things

79
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,479
collectively according to Fier they
wouldn't be so wasteful Fier also

80
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,960
thought that capitalist societies had
unnecessarily depressing work lives and

81
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,000
he thought we could reorganize our work
lives in a way that would make people

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,240
more passionate for example you could
divide people up into teams and have

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,160
them compete against each other for
honors or rotate jobs throughout the day

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
so no one has to work for more than a
couple hours in any role he thought you

85
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
didn't have to force people to do this
stuff if a few intentional communities

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,360
first set an example he thought others
would follow they would be brought

87
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,199
together by a lure of gain and Pleasures
as he put it if a unified Society

88
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,319
produced three times as much as an
atomized Society people would be

89
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,919
incentivized to unify Robert Owen had a
theory that people were products of

90
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,240
their environment and as such he thought
we should use our resources to make

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,360
people better make them happier make
them Kinder better mannered and more

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,319
productive he thought the best place to
do that would be through education when

93
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,520
people are young and impressionable and
he specifically saw the government as a

94
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,639
means to that end Owen thought
governments should establish rational

95
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,160
plans for the education and general
formation of the characters of their

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,120
subjects focusing on forming their
character in childhood which he thought

97
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,000
would prevent bad habits from forming
like lying or Waning to hurt others and

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,680
he thought it would promote good habits
like waning to help others this is

99
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,120
essentially a reaction against the
individualism of liberalism so liberals

100
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,440
tend to think that if you're doing well
in life or if you're doing badly in life

101
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,360
it's your own fault and here he's
flipping that he's saying it's not

102
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,840
necessarily the indiv ual's fault but
rather it's the fault of the environment

103
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,599
Owen thought that this explained the
squalid conditions of the poor saying

104
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,680
shall the well-being of millions of the
poor half naked half famished untaught

105
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,199
and untrained daily increasing to a most
alarming extent in these islands not

106
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
call Forth One petition one delegate or
one rational effective legislative

107
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,560
measure no for such has been our
education Owen also believed that happy

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,879
employees are more productive
he set up a community that paid

109
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,560
unusually high wages that also had
Pleasant working conditions and had

110
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
comfortable homes for the workers these
are just a few of their arguments that

111
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,800
shaped socialism going forward looked at
more fully none of them were properly

112
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,000
socialists as we understand the word now
for example when s Simone imagined

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,599
himself addressing the working class he
wrote we are 10 times 20 times 100 times

114
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,800
more numerous than the possessors and
yet the possessors wield over us a

115
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,200
domination far greater than any power we
have over them then he says I realize my

116
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,640
friends how entirely frustrated you are
but note that the possessors although

117
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,519
inferior in number possess more
Enlightenment than you and that for the

118
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,519
general good domination must be
distributed according to the share of

119
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,120
intelligence look at what happened in
France while your comrades were dominant

120
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,440
there they produced a famine I think
this illustrates that we have since then

121
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,040
established a definitive idea of what is
and is not socialist so you should be

122
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,720
able ble to look at what s Simon said
and see exactly where it jumped ship and

123
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,440
isn't socialist anymore and that's where
he accepts hierarchies and even frames

124
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
them as being natural and even for the
greater good the Socialist conception of

125
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,800
equalitarianism means that socialists
want to mitigate hierarchies they

126
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,279
probably don't want to frame them as
being natural and they especially don't

127
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,600
want to frame them as being for the
greater good a major figure that

128
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,880
solidified that conception of
equalitarianism is a man named babou who

129
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,800
wrote Under the name graas so he
sometimes called graas babou babou

130
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,720
emerged during the French Revolution
while the revolutionaries were trying to

131
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,079
figure out how to order their new
Society the French revolution's ethic

132
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,959
was based on the twin principles of
Liberty and equality the word fraternity

133
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,800
was in there too but Liberty and
equality were their main principles the

134
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,680
philosopher John ja rouso was an
influence on the French Revolution on

135
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,839
the whole but his social contract and
discourse on inequality were especially

136
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,920
an influence on babo who saw himself as
simply implementing Russo's theories

137
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,279
babou came forward and wanted the
revolutionaries to take the word

138
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,519
equality much more seriously he wanted
their new Society to settle for nothing

139
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,240
less than perfect class equality he
wanted for all individuals without

140
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,800
distinction an absolutely equal portion
of all the goods since men are

141
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,760
absolutely equal Babu fruit they must
not have any private possessions but

142
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,240
must enjoy everything in common so that
no one can by the mere fact of birth be

143
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,680
either more or less rich or be
considered less worthy than any of those

144
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,800
around him which makes babou arguably
the founder of modern communism this was

145
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,279
explicitly intended to end class
distinctions baban his associates made

146
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,639
that clear in their Manifesto of the
equals where they said let it come to

147
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,320
end at last this great Scandal that our
posterity will never believe disappear

148
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,240
at last revolting distinctions between
rich and poor great and small Masters

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,880
and servants Governors and governed let
there be no differences between human

150
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,880
beings other than those of age and sex
babou also brought a revolutionary

151
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,320
ideology to socialism which means you
want a sudden thorough transformation of

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,240
society typically by seizing power babo
and his associates plotted to take over

153
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,639
the Revolution and Lead it themselves
making them the first to imagine

154
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,000
Revolution as a calculated process
directed by a Vanguard of cons

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,839
conspirators whose goals might be
unknown to the mass of their followers

156
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,440
this might be reminding you of a later
socialist who had actually successfully

157
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,920
do that and who will get to bab's plot
was discovered by the revolutionaries

158
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,839
they weren't in a forgiving mood so that
was the end of babo but he would live on

159
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,720
as an influence for Communists who would
emerge after him in Europe This is Bab

160
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,000
being referenced in The Communist
Manifesto the term socialism was coined

161
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,720
by the followers of Robert Owen in the
18 20s as capitalism developed through

162
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,680
the early to mid 1800s it became
increasingly industrialized and with

163
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,839
that class distinctions sharpened a
self-conscious industrial working class

164
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,680
began to take shape in England and
Western Europe new types of socialists

165
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,519
emerged that framed their theories
through class conflict the socioeconomic

166
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
halves against the socioeconomic have
knots and they specifically saw the have

167
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,600
knots as being the industrial working
class who they called the proletariat

168
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,760
but these socialists tended to be middle
class and they saw themselves as needing

169
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,639
to lead and educate the working class
one of those was Louis blany who said

170
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,839
the poor man does not know the source of
his ills ignorance the daughter of

171
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,560
subjection makes him into the docile
instrument of the privileged crushed by

172
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,279
toil a stranger to the intellectual life
what can he know about these social

173
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,279
phenomena in which he plays the role of
the Beast of Burden another leading

174
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,279
socialists that emerged was Pierre
Joseph prudon he wanted a society based

175
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,839
in mutualism which is essentially an
anarchist Society a society with no

176
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,600
government where workers sell their
labor to each other there were many

177
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,360
other thinkers during that time period
like Louis Blanc who wanted to extend

178
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,240
voting rights to the working class but
none of these are names that people

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,600
really know anymore in the mid 1800s one
figure rose up and dominated socialism

180
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,480
with his ideas easily becoming the
biggest figure in the tradition and that

181
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,639
of course is KL Marx Marx came from a
philosophical tradition of system

182
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,519
building which was popular up until his
time but isn't really done anymore so

183
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,560
system building is when you make an
elaborate self-contained body of work

184
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,199
that tries to explain just about
everything as bertron Russell put it

185
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,320
Marx was the last of the great system
Builders I think this brought an

186
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,000
intellectual grandiosity to socialism
that hasn't been matched since there

187
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,120
were all these separate socialist ideas
floating around at the time that had

188
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,279
mostly come from France and England and
what Marx did was to combin them

189
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,839
together with a German philosophy
popular in his time which was the

190
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,240
philosophy of gorg Hegel I'm going to
spend some time laying this out because

191
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,320
it's crucial to understanding what Marx
brought to socialism and it's also

192
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,920
crucial to understanding what happened
to socialism going forward Marx was

193
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,720
influenced by Hegel who was influenced
by Aristotle who was influenced by Plato

194
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,320
all four were system Builders with
Aristotle and Plato there's only one

195
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,399
aspect of their thought that we're
concerned with here and that's their

196
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,360
idea of essence Plato was interested in
the difference between universals and

197
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,920
particulars for example think of the
word cat just the abstract concept of a

198
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,040
cat it's not any one cat in particular
it transcends them it's a universal

199
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,759
concept an ideal cat any one particular
cat for Plato is always made imp

200
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:04,320
perfectly in the image of the ideal cat
so the ideal cat contains the essence of

201
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,519
cat which we could call cattiness it's
an Essence that exists outside of

202
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,040
particular cats it exists before they do
when they come into existence it shapes

203
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,279
their size their health their strength
and also their behavior for example

204
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,320
Plato thought these Essences explained
why like things gravitate toward one

205
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,319
another a rock dropped Falls to be with
other rocks rocks Fire Rises to be with

206
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:37,079
a each thing has a tendency to be toward
its Kindred element that tendency makes

207
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:42,160
the heavy go down and the light go up
Aristotle seemed to believe that he was

208
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,560
updating Plato's Essence by claiming
that it's not external but inside you

209
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,759
it's what you are by your very nature
Aristotelian Essences are things that

210
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,279
you can't change and still be you like
your Humanity for example these essences

211
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,399
shap shape your properties and your
potentialities they shape how you look

212
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,399
and how you feel and also how you move
and how you behave through these

213
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,079
Essences things possess the principle of
motion in themselves Aristotle used that

214
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,920
to develop his theory of natural places
if things are removed from their natural

215
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,560
place because of these Essences they
have a tendency to return to it also for

216
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Aristotle Essence can precede existence
he said things can subsist as a sort of

217
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,560
potential energy before they become
actualized before a house is built for

218
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,680
example it was fit for being built the
fact that it was fit for being built

219
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,680
acts as an essential cause that builds
the house we're talking about ancient

220
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,920
philosophy here part of this was an
attempt to explain the world before the

221
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,519
discovery of genes and before Newtonian
physics around Newton's time things

222
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,079
started to sharpen and become less
mystical but even that was a slow

223
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,720
gradual change so Western philosophy was
differential to Aristotle and Plato for

224
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,319
some 2,000 years after their time as a
result the notion of essence was an

225
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,559
intimate part of every Western
philosophy subsequent to Aristotle until

226
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:17,520
we came to Modern Times gor Hegel
writing in early 1800s Prussia was in

227
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,640
that sense a pre-modern thinker he took
Aristotle's notion of essence and

228
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,919
applied it to history he wanted to
answer the question what is the ultimate

229
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,960
design of the world and he answered that
due to these hidden undeveloped Essences

230
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,880
the world had a principle it had a plan
of existence a law and that law was a

231
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,440
law of historical progress a progression
from the imperfect towards the more

232
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,320
perfect as evidence he pointed to the
spreading of Freedom over time and

233
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,760
pointed to the Prussian monarchy where
he lived as a place where all had

234
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
finally achieved Freedom it's a
redefinition of the word Freedom so if

235
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
that was confusing to you I wouldn't
lose sleep over it the point is that

236
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
Hegel thought that these hidden
undeveloped Essences brought an

237
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,320
inexorable logic to the history of the
world and that was to make it move over

238
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,919
time towards this increasing Perfection
and for Hegel this was both an ethical

239
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,159
and a logical Perfection Hegel thought
that the spirit of nations were

240
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,960
ultimately the drivers of History they
drove history forward so hegel's

241
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,240
philosophy was ultimately nationalist
Marx grew up studying Hegel so he wanted

242
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,320
to take hegel's ideas and place them in
an updated socialist context during

243
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,600
Marx's time Enlightenment values were
spreading and hegel's idea that the

244
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,320
world was driven forward by Spirit was
too mystical for Marx so he preferred to

245
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,960
base his theory in matter literally
physical stuff specifically physical

246
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,880
stuff that relates to the economy and
our ability to provide for ourselves

247
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,320
like land and coal and machines so Marx
called those material conditions and

248
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,520
believed that they determined deted the
kind of economy we have as he put it the

249
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,280
windmill gives you Society with the
feudal Lord the steam Mill Society with

250
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,159
the industrial capitalist you can call
the type of economy we have like a

251
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,520
capitalist one our mode of production
and then Mark says the mode of

252
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,360
production in material life determines
the general character of the social

253
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,679
political and spiritual processes of
life so for Marx everything stems from

254
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,960
Material conditions the material
conditions create capitalism and from

255
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,960
there you have the way we think our
culture our law politics Society so as

256
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,000
material conditions change society
changes along with them unlike Adam

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,400
Smith who saw capitalism as bringing
people together into voluntary and

258
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,159
mutually beneficial relationships Carl
Marx saw antagonism when he looked at

259
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:55,080
capitalism he saw involuntary labor and
class conflict lower class people had to

260
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,159
work if they didn't they would starve if
you asked workers ERS how much they

261
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,640
wanted to be paid their answer would be
as much as possible but if you asked

262
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,039
bosses how much they should pay the
workers the bosses would answer as

263
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,840
little as possible also if you ask these
bosses how hard they should work these

264
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,400
workers the answer would be as hard as
possible after all they had other

265
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,760
businesses to compete with Marx like
Hegel believed that history was

266
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,200
Progressive and he believed that class
conflict drove that historical

267
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,240
progression so classes were for Marks
what nations were for Hegel as Marx

268
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,799
wrote the history of all hitherto
existing Society is the history of class

269
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,480
struggles Freeman and slave Patrician
and plebian Lord and Surf guildmaster

270
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,559
and journeyman in a word oppressor and
oppressed stood in constant opposition

271
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,159
to one another carried on an
uninterrupted Now hidden now open fight

272
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,600
a fight that each time ended either in a
revolutionary reconstitution of society

273
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,880
at large or in the common ruin of the
contending classes when one class wins a

274
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,840
class struggle according to this Theory
a new Society is created so when

275
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,120
middleclass Journeymen won power against
Guild Masters and implemented modern

276
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,000
property rights feudalism ended and
capitalism began and again he argued

277
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
that the underlying Force here is
changing material conditions he argued

278
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
that it was time for feudalism to go
Marx believed that the new societies

279
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,159
were preferable to the ones that came
before for example he credits the

280
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,679
Bourgeois who are the property owning
class in capitalism with creating

281
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,279
enormous cities which greatly increased
the urban population as compared with

282
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,799
the rural and thus rescued a
considerable part of the population from

283
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,799
the idiocy of rural life but Marx still
fundamentally condemned the capitalism

284
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,640
of his time and the society that came
along with it this was a time when

285
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,799
capitalism was mostly unregulated so he
had child labor and you had longer hours

286
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,640
and low pay and and dangerous conditions
the lowest paid workers at the time were

287
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,840
working for subsistence wages which
means that they were barely making

288
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,120
enough to be able to feed themselves
Marx didn't leave his feelings about

289
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,440
these things up for interpretation he
found it morally horrifying he pointed

290
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,559
out average life expectancies for the
working class around Urban England where

291
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,080
he did most of his writing in Manchester
it was 17 years in Liverpool it was just

292
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,240
15 he believed that the problem was the
legal right to own private property by

293
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,720
that he mostly meant property relating
to Industry so it could be factories

294
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,919
could be machines could be products
coming out of a company or the

295
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,919
intellectual property of a company
itself so private property for Marks is

296
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,600
mostly property relating to Industry and
in his analysis he broke capitalist

297
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,200
societies down into two main classes you
had the bisi who owned private property

298
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,559
and you had the proletariat who were
propertyless industrial workers he

299
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,480
thought the right to own private
property gave the bourgeois Supreme

300
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,039
political power in capitalist societies
making them the ruling class what we

301
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,159
would normally call liberal Society to
him was Bourgeois Society so he thought

302
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,480
the law morality and religion coming
from capitalist societies reflected

303
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,320
Bourgeois prejudices and Bourgeois
interests it's not clear how aware Marx

304
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,400
was of the implications of this next
part but he crucially took an idea of

305
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,000
Hegel and applied it to his theory and
that's hegel's idea that due to a hidden

306
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,200
developed Essence human societies had a
law of historical development like Hegel

307
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,120
he believed Society was inexorably
moving towards an increasing Perfection

308
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,039
and also like Hegel this was both an
ethical and a logical Perfection he said

309
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,159
if the conflict hinges on the right to
own private property and if the people

310
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,880
without property far outnumber the
people with property then the solution

311
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,480
is for the propertyless masses to
realize their common oppression than to

312
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,159
ban together rise up seize power and
Implement a new Society a communist

313
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,120
Society where the right to own private
property is abolished which he thought

314
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,559
would finally break the historical Saga
of class Conflict by being the first

315
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:17,159
Society without class conflict as he
wrote in his 20s communism is the riddle

316
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:23,200
of History solved and it knows itself to
be this solution as markx got older he

317
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,039
toned down that kind of mystical talk
but his historicist conviction and his

318
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:33,679
support for communism remained the fall
of capitalism and the rise of Communism

319
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,679
he maintained was inevitable this is an
end of History kind of argument he's

320
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,480
saying that capitalism is the last form
of society to feature class conflict and

321
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,039
that communism will be the first Society
without class conflict which will bring

322
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:53,960
on a new era of History so everything up
until that to Marks is prehistory I

323
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,600
think this is a good time to nail down
what communism is communism is a type of

324
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,799
socialism so socialism is the broad
tradition and communism is a specific

325
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:08,600
variant of the mainstream types of
socialism communism is probably the

326
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,240
furthest to the left it has three main
features one is the abolition of private

327
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,559
property which is at least any kind of
property relating to Industry which is

328
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,720
also called the means of production the
second feature is its goal it wants to

329
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,919
abolish class distinctions so the goal
is a society with no class inequality in

330
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,399
Marx's writing the dictatorship of the
proletariat holds power which is his

331
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,240
term for the Communist working class
once they take power although he never

332
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,000
clearly articulated what that means or
what that looks like one important thing

333
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,760
he did say was to say that the
dictatorship of the proletariat was to

334
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,480
take all capital from the Bourgeois and
to place all instruments of production

335
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,960
in the hands of the state what's
supposed to happen from there is a

336
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,200
matter of debate Marx saw communism as
an international movement which would

337
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,799
transcend nationality and eventually
sweep the world which led to a history

338
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,679
of international aspirations in
communism and even socialism more

339
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,399
broadly but I think it's worth saying
that this hasn't been consistent in

340
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:12,960
practice even Marx himself leaned into
nationalism when times seemed to call

341
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,039
for it Marx thought communism would
develop in stages he thought there'd be

342
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,039
a lower stage where he'd still have
wealth inequality since people don't

343
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,520
have equal needs or ability to work but
he seemed to think that in a higher

344
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,679
stage of communist Society all Goods
would be publicly owned and wealth

345
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,600
distinctions and perhaps money itself
would disappear as he wrote once all the

346
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,640
Springs of Cooperative wealth flow more
abundantly only then can the narrow

347
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,440
Horizon of Bourgeois right be crossed in
its entirety and Society inscribe on its

348
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,320
banners from each according to his
ability to each according to his needs

349
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,880
marks thought in that kind of society
where the public had control over

350
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,720
resources people would have more freedom
to choose what they want to do in their

351
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,000
work lives so he thought people wouldn't
be forced to specialize like they often

352
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,840
are in capitalist societies he thought
people would be free to do one thing

353
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,000
today and another tomorrow to hunt in
the morning fish in the afternoon rear

354
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,080
cattle in the evening or criticize after
dinner although that last bit was

355
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,240
probably a joke on his part markx
refrained from elaborating much more on

356
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,720
his vision for communism he said he
didn't want to write receipts for the

357
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,720
cook shops of the future he instead
spent most of his writing criticizing

358
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,480
his competitors and laying out his
economic theory that we mostly see in

359
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,640
capital which he believed proved the
inevitable fall of capitalism and Rise

360
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,320
of Communism as he wrote Capital aimed
to lay be the economic law of motion of

361
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,880
modern society his theory essentially
claims that in capitalism business

362
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,000
owners extract as much profit as they
possibly can from their workers while

363
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,159
paying them as little as they can back
in return the business owners then take

364
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,679
those profits and use them to expand
their businesses Buy more machines and

365
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,720
develop technology which further
develops the material conditions of

366
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,360
capitalism as this continues and
business owners compete with each other

367
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,480
and push everyone else's wages down as
Marx described it a few winners would

368
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,320
emerge and the great masses would be
pushed down into poverty and subsistence

369
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,480
wages Marx described this as two large
polls developing on one end you have the

370
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,919
accumulation of wealth which again was
supposed to be into fewer and fewer

371
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,919
hands and on the other end you have an
accumulation of misery Agony of toil

372
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,159
slavery ignorance brutality mental
degradation he said that as there was

373
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,600
this growing mass of misery there'd be a
corresponding growing revolutionary

374
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,640
impulse an eventual Revolt of the
working class as material conditions and

375
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,080
the social conditions that correspond to
them continued to develop in that manner

376
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,320
they eventually outgrow capitalism
bursting it like a shell once that

377
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,600
happened he thought a revolution would
occur as he wrote The Nail of capitalist

378
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,960
private properties sounds the
expropriators are expropriated so with

379
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,720
that the die was cast I think that
aspect of marks has since been

380
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,679
downplayed but at the time it was the
centerpiece of Marxism the question was

381
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,679
will it happen or won't it happen in the
decades following Marx's death

382
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,360
capitalism seemed to be developing in
the way that Marx predicted class

383
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,039
Dynamics seemed to be polarizing and
sharpening Marxist parties sprang up

384
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,200
across Europe and the German Socialist
Party emerged as an international leader

385
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,960
of socialism and was explicitly Marxist
it occupied an increasing number of

386
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,480
seats in the local state and National
legislatures controlled immense trade

387
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,640
unions and was exceedingly welld
disciplined and organized acting in the

388
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,440
belief that marxian sociology provided
irrefutable Assurance of its ultimate

389
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,039
Triumph but in the last decade of the
19th century ominous contradictions to

390
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,240
Marxism began to appear capitalism was
reforming and becoming gentler misery

391
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,480
wasn't increasing it seemed to be
shrinking wealth was spreading across

392
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,919
all classes of society and the working
class didn't seem to be turning towards

393
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,039
communism marxists were faced with a
choice stick with the position that Marx

394
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,760
was right which was the Orthodox Marxist
position or say that at least in some

395
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,880
aspects he was wrong which implies
diversifying your sources of belief the

396
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,760
person who came to embody the latter
position was a man named Edward

397
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,360
Bernstein Bernstein was a highly
regarded Marxist he was mentored by

398
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,080
Marx's collaborator frederck angles he
was even asked by Engles to produce a

399
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,679
new volume of capital based on Marx's
notes But as time went on these Trends

400
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,919
troubled Bernstein and they reached a
point where he couldn't reconcile them

401
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,720
with his commitment to Marx anymore he
wrote a book called evolutionary

402
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,320
socialism as an extended critique on
Marx that brought about a split in

403
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,399
socialism that Still Remains to this day
marxists at the time gave Bernstein's

404
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,399
views a name revisionism to show that
the historical Trend that Marx predicted

405
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,559
wasn't occurring Bernstein checked
certain statements in capital against

406
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,799
modern evidence like tax receipts and
concludes that it is quite wrong to

407
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,880
assume that the present development of
society shows a relative or indeed

408
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,240
absolute diminution of the number of the
members of the possessing classes their

409
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,639
number increases both relatively and
absolutely if you just looked at what

410
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:24,000
was happening in society he argued
Improvement was unmistakable Society was

411
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,679
transforming in a Humane Direction which
signifies not hopelessness but

412
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,320
capability of improvement in the
condition of the worker he said it is

413
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,600
not only useless it is the greatest
Folly to attempt to conceal this from

414
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,279
ourselves he also broke from Marx as a
theorist for example by saying that his

415
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,480
framing wasn't pluralistic it doesn't
make sense to speak of workers as a

416
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,440
homogeneous mass and he criticized
traditional socialist goals he called

417
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,559
the experiments that had been done with
Collective societies until then sad

418
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,960
experiences that were causing people in
socialist circles to turn their backs

419
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,919
more and more on the whole Cooperative
movement he even called Central planning

420
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,760
absurd he calculated how much work it
might take for a government to direct an

421
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,480
economy in an advanced European country
and concluded what abundance of judgment

422
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,200
practical knowledge talent for
administration must a government or a

423
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,120
National Assembly have at its disposal
to be even equal to the Supreme

424
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,720
Management or managing control of such a
gigantic organism in the meantime he

425
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,480
argued that socialists were actually
making progress by working

426
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,840
democratically within the system in all
advanced countries he said we see the

427
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,919
Privileges of the capitalist Bourgeois
yielding step-by step to democratic

428
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,039
organizations as a result he said
socialists in those countries are no

429
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,960
longer dreaming of an imminent victory
for socialism by means of a violent

430
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,440
revolution and instead they rely more
and more on work in the municipalities

431
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,639
and other self-governing bodies then he
reframes the goal of socialism he says

432
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,679
to me that which is generally called the
the ultimate aim of socialism is nothing

433
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,320
but the movement is everything this is
now I believe the most highly regarded

434
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,159
mission statement we have for Democratic
socialism the idea of achieving

435
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:13,799
socialism by gradual reforms surfaced
during Marx's time which was led by

436
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,799
Ferdinand Lal but Marx found it
unsettling and he wrote a letter

437
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,559
denouncing it he said as far as we are
concerned there is only one way open for

438
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,000
almost 40 years now we have emphasized
the class struggle as the fundamental d

439
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,240
driving force of history and especially
the class struggle between Bourgeois and

440
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,039
proletariat as the great lever of modern
social upheaval it is impossible for us

441
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,399
to go together with people who wish to
strike this class struggle from the

442
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:44,159
movement so Orthodox marxists ended up
defeating LOL it's also probably worth

443
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,679
saying that there was a socialist
gradualist organization active in

444
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,840
England for about a decade before
Bernstein called the Fabian Society

445
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,960
which used an image of a tortoise as a
symbol for gradualism but they did have

446
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,440
an end goal of complete socialism it was
Bernstein's position that the ultimate

447
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,240
aim of socialism is nothing but the
movement is everything that ended up

448
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,919
leading Democratic Socialist thought so
Bernstein is generally recognized as

449
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:13,159
sort of the father of democratic
socialism the gradualist argument if you

450
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,760
think about it breaks Orthodox Marxism
if workers are making improvements in

451
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,200
their lives through gradual reforms then
they're becoming less miserable they now

452
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,200
have something to lose besides their
chains so why would they risk their

453
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,879
lives in a sudden and probably violent
revolution if they could improve their

454
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,320
lives peacefully and democratically by
working within the system so the further

455
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,720
we move towards reformism the further
away we move from Marx's prediction

456
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,599
strictly understood this led to a split
that was framed as a question within

457
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:51,040
Marxism reform or revolution reformists
more or less went with Bernstein and

458
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,679
revolutionists stuck with the Orthodox
position Rosa Luxembourg distinguished

459
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,760
herself by publishing a popular pamphlet
affirming the Revolutionary position the

460
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,160
head of the German Socialist Party Carl
kotsky also reaffirmed the Orthodox

461
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,160
Marxist position over and over but
reformism seemed to be the winning

462
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,960
argument in the long term within about
20 years most socialists in the party

463
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,119
moved over to Bernstein's Camp the next
and in my opinion the last major

464
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,680
development in socialism came from
Vladimir Lenin I think Lenin's

465
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,480
contribution to socialism can be mainly
understood in in two phrases neither of

466
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,520
which he said but both I think summarize
his philosophy well the first is that

467
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,160
the revolution must happen socialism
must be implemented by any means

468
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,359
necessary lenon was both committed and
creative he believed in throwing himself

469
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,800
into a problem and figuring things out
as he went something captured in a

470
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,359
Napoleonic Maxim that lenon was fond of
saying he was also a devout Marxist who

471
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,359
treated Marx's writing like scripture
like Marx lenon was was also a

472
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,119
historicist he was driven by an absolute
faith in his own historical destiny the

473
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,440
destiny of leading a Marxist Revolution
lendon was convinced that he would be

474
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,800
the one to wield the conductor's Baton
as he put it in order to make this

475
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,720
revolution happen the first problem that
Lennon had to deal with was the fact

476
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,319
that communism wasn't spreading among
the working class like Marx predicted in

477
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:24,599
other words class Consciousness wasn't
spreading lenon made this out to be not

478
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,640
only not a problem but natural he said
historically socialism including Marxism

479
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,839
comes from the upper classes from
educated intellectuals he then implied

480
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,440
that the reason why it hadn't spread
among the working class was that it's

481
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,720
too complicated he goes on at length
about how difficult it is to educate

482
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,720
someone to give them genuine class
Consciousness as he sees it implying

483
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,280
this is something the working class
can't figure out on their own so he

484
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,800
concluded that class Consciousness
cannot come from the working class it

485
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,440
has to come from without out so that was
a major break in socialism since Elites

486
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,119
are the ones who understand Marxism as
he argued then the revolution needs to

487
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,280
be led by those Elites in other words by
a Vanguard so this Vanguard of Elites is

488
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,319
as he said to stand undeviatingly on the
basis of Marxism while it leads the

489
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:21,319
whole of the political struggle with a
staff of professional agitators so in

490
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:25,960
Orthodox Marxism also called classical
Marxism workers are supposed to lead the

491
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,680
revolution and hold power once the
revolution succeeds in leninism Elites

492
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,480
lead the Revolution and hold power once
it succeeds so Orthodox Marxism is

493
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,760
bottom up and Lennon's philosophy is top
down Elites claim to rule in the name of

494
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,520
the people Lenin's philosophy of
Revolution by any means necessary meant

495
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,680
that the Bolsheviks maintained a certain
amount of ideological and moral

496
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,240
flexibility for example the Bolsheviks
made allies on their way into power but

497
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,720
when they saw opportunity to suddenly
seize power for themselves they took it

498
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,400
then promptly turned to destroy all
parties opposed to that seizure they

499
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,440
also called themselves internationalists
but then leaned into nationalism once

500
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,480
they realized its psychological power
the Bolsheviks also made themselves out

501
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,880
as the party of Peace something that
made them popular among Russian soldiers

502
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,000
at the time but then shortly after
coming into Power were embroiled in a

503
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,760
Civil War as well as Wars with Ukraine
Armenia and Georgia as they all tried to

504
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,640
separate from the Union and also a war
with Poland to give one more example the

505
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,560
Bolsheviks allowed an election once they
came into power when that election

506
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,000
refuted them they dissolved the
constituent assembly ending democracy in

507
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,079
the Soviet Union so for the Bolsheviks
getting power and implementing socialism

508
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,160
as they saw it was the overriding goal
they said what they needed to say and

509
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,599
they did whatever they thought they
needed to do in order to make that

510
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,599
happen the second phrase to understand
leninism is the phrase there shall be no

511
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,480
dissent within the party to understand
Lennon's position on that you could look

512
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,920
at how he defined the word Freedom
dealing with calls for free speech in

513
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,560
his time he said freedom is a grand word
but the type of Freedom that socialists

514
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,599
needed he argued was freedom from
dissent freedom to express your ideas

515
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,280
without anyone conflicting with it he
said socialists need complete Liberty to

516
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,040
reveal to the working class that its
interests are diametrically opposed to

517
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,920
the interests of the bourgeois in
Lennon's framing there are only two

518
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,200
choices socialist or Bourgeois ideology
there's nothing in between and within

519
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,839
that he calls for absolute Conformity to
socialism he says to belittle socialist

520
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,560
ideology in any way to deviate from it
in the slightest degree means

521
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,359
strengthening Bourgeois ideology in
practice this meant Absolute Conformity

522
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,960
to lenon since Lenin system was a top-
down one and he dictated what socialist

523
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,319
ideology was when the Bolsheviks first
first came into power in 1917 no other

524
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:04,760
political party had ever been so closely
tied to the personality of a single man

525
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,160
as Orlando FES put it in practice this
led to a style of rule that can best be

526
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,960
described as authoritarian so Marxism
leninism is an authoritarian style of

527
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,480
socialism this also typically means an
effectively onep party State Marxist

528
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,200
leninists don't tolerate political
opposition if it's deemed a threat to

529
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,440
the state they also typically use
propaganda to enforce their messaging

530
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,720
and censorship to block ideas that are
deemed politically harmful this also

531
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,839
typically means Mass imprisonment of
political opposition and some sort of

532
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:39,200
secret police that surveils the
population with Lenin's CA setting the

533
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,720
example for that who later became the
KGB the Bolsheviks also heavily

534
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,160
repressed the Russian Orthodox church
and tried to replace their religious

535
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,880
Authority with the authority of the
communist state so they encouraged a

536
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,839
sort of new warship of the state which
at first was mainly done through

537
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:01,240
propaganda with Lenin at its head
complete with socialist icons like marks

538
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,200
and Engles replacing traditional
religious ones being socialists Marxist

539
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,640
leninist States also typically take
steps to reduce socioeconomic

540
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,359
hierarchies for example once Russia's
economy stabilized under Lenin's New

541
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,240
Economic Policy the Bolsheviks spread
electricity throughout the Russian

542
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,560
Countryside for the first time in its
history the Bolsheviks also ran on an

543
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,319
all power to the Soviets slogan which at
first when the government was weak meant

544
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,160
the direct self-rule of the peasantry
soldiers and workers another Bolshevik

545
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,680
slogan was loot the looters which was
apparently designed to justify

546
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,160
workingclass resentment and direct
action against the rich this ended up

547
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,280
being a winning formula for gaining
power in the 20th century Marxist

548
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,839
leninists were able to use it to come
into power in China southeast Asia

549
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:56,760
Eastern Europe subsaharan Africa and
Cuba all Marxist leninists tend to be welfare

550
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,760
for example by trying to provide housing
and full employment and healthare

551
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,400
economically speaking Marxist leninists
tend to be pretty experimental they tend

552
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,400
to abolish certain types of property
ownership and nationalize certain

553
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,319
industries they've also historically run
experiments with Collective work namely

554
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:19,359
with Collective Farms London's first few
years in office were especially

555
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,960
experimental with his War communism
which even tried to abolish money and

556
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,280
replace it with a universal system of
State passing but their policies tend to

557
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,680
eventually settle somewhere between
capitalism and communism we call Marxist

558
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,000
leninist Communists not because their
policies are fully communistic but

559
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,960
because on one hand they tend to call
themselves that and on the other hand it

560
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,880
helps us distinguish them from other
types of thinkers who aren't inspired by

561
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,680
communism like other types of socialists
and liberals in the Years following

562
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,119
World War II people were looking for
solutions that were more moderate and

563
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,599
hopefully more stable than those
provided by authoritarians in the

564
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,720
decades prior that led to the mass
adoption of liberal democracy throughout

565
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,000
the world especially in Europe the
Socialists that were content to work

566
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,440
within that system were Democratic
socialists and their influence led to

567
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,280
the spread of socialist ideas throughout
Europe it was thought that if the

568
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,000
government brought inequality under
control for example by providing housing

569
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,400
or health care or mandating higher wages
that would make for a happier and

570
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,880
therefore more stable Society the views
of liberals and socialists began to blur

571
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,920
it became normal for liberals to want
some amount of welfare and regulated

572
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,640
capitalism and it became normal for
socialists to be okay with capitalism

573
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,720
and some amount of income inequality so
people generally started to think more

574
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,720
in terms of compromise and moderation
the story of democratic socialism from

575
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,880
World War II onward typically isn't told
as the story of standout individuals but

576
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,800
instead it's told as the story of
political parties the German Socialist

577
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,160
Party had long been seen as discredited
following their decision to support the

578
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,640
Kaiser and join World War I the British
labor party and Swedish social Democrats

579
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,760
instead took up the mantle as Democratic
socialists they don't tend to have any

580
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,040
kind of end goal in mind like complete
socialism and instead they focus their

581
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,839
efforts on trying to diagnose problems
in their time as they see it and solving

582
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,000
those problems through peac Mill reforms
one notable shift in Democratic

583
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,119
Socialist philosophy was to move support
away from Central planning and from the

584
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,280
government owning the means of
production basically experiments with

585
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,960
those policies in the 20th century
didn't work out as well as many had

586
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,359
hoped countries that tried those
policies tended to struggle economically

587
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:44,480
and it tended to lead to all kinds of
other problems like corruption and even

588
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,000
worse which was a general understanding
that the fall of the Soviet Union seemed

589
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,720
to confirm you can see the change in
their Outlook in the change of clause 4

590
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,559
from the British labor party's
Constitution in 1918 Clause 4 said that

591
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,440
the party's purpose was to secure for
the workers the full fruits of their

592
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,880
industry and the most equitable
distribution thereof that may be

593
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,920
possible upon the basis of the common
ownership of the means of production

594
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,200
distribution and exchange but in 1995
the Clause was revised to say that the

595
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,760
party now wants a dynamic economy
serving the public interest in which the

596
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,720
Enterprise of the market and the rigor
of competition are joined with the

597
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,800
forces of partnership and cooperation to
produce the wealth the nation needs and

598
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,319
the opportunity for all to work and
prosper with a thriving private sector

599
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:37,599
and high quality Public Services where
those undertakings essential to the

600
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,440
common good are either owned by the
public or accountable to them so you can

601
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,440
see they're adopting a more moderate
position and endorsing some amount of

602
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,559
capitalism the Swedish Social Democratic
party was the most electorally

603
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,119
successful Democratic Socialist Party in
the 20th century consistently winning

604
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,319
elections in SW Sweden between the 30s
and the 80s they distinguished

605
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,920
themselves by toning down ideas of class
conflict and instead pitching a kind of

606
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,839
universal socialism a socialism that
represents the people as a whole as a

607
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,839
party leader put it in 1934 the party
and its policies don't differentiate

608
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,640
between progress for the industrial
proletariat and the agricultural classes

609
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,880
or workers of the hand and brain instead
the party's efforts are based on the

610
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,599
conviction that Society has a special
responsibility to ensure care for those

611
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:31,200
most in need regardless of who they are
this is people's politics in the word's

612
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,880
truest meaning Democratic socialism
means different things to different

613
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,200
people but generally speaking they don't
want the government to own the means of

614
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,160
production anymore and they don't want
the government to direct the economy

615
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,359
they also don't explicitly see
themselves as representing the working

616
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:47,880
class they see themselves as
representing people's interests more

617
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,599
broadly if I had to venture a mission
statement for Democratic socialists

618
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,760
besides Bernstein's I think it would go
something like in a world without Dem

619
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,839
Democratic socialists people work for
capitalism in a world with Democratic

620
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,200
socialists capitalism works for people
this video covered the main currents of

621
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,520
socialism as seen through the lens of
the 21st century namely Marxism Marxism

622
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,440
leninism and Democratic socialism there
are many other types of socialism that

623
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,119
either were briefly touched on here or
not mentioned at all for example there

624
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,440
are other types of authoritarian
socialists say in South America and

625
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,400
Africa who are somewhat less committed
to Marx and police States but also

626
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,440
uncommitted to open and fair elections
and rule of law syndicalism could also

627
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,319
be treated as an honorable mention in
socialism syndicalism is seen as an idea

628
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:41,319
that has been long dead but syndicalists
were influential around the turn of the

629
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:45,720
20th century they wanted a new Society
where trade unions were the highest

630
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,160
political Authority but I think that's
enough said to wrap things up the

631
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,359
purpose of the video was to answer the
question what is socialism I'll give a

632
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,359
concise answer here but I think the rest
of the video should be treated as the

633
00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:00,240
longer more thorough answer to the
question so if the question is what is

634
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,319
socialism I'd say it's a socioeconomic
philosophy primarily concerned with

635
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:10,280
shaping wealth institutions or economic
activity according to various

636
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,760
interpretations of equalitarianism I
think that's about as simultaneously

637
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,440
precise and Broad as we can get the only
alternative I can think of is to base a

638
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,280
definition on the principle of
Association like Bernstein did which you

639
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,240
could also call the principle of
cooperation or collectivism in my

640
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:32,240
opinion equalitarianism runs deeper I
see collectivism as a common solution in

641
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,920
socialism and equalitarianism as the
motivating principle that runs through

642
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,079
the tradition so to Define socialism by
saying that it's based in the principle

643
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,800
of collectivism I think is fine for
basically all intents and purposes but

644
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,400
if we're going to nitpick I'd say that
it gets it subtly wrong I'd say

645
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,960
collectivism is more of a solution and
equalitarianism is the motivating

646
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,720
principle so where does that lead leave
us with the central planning definition

647
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,720
that definition is based in a moment in
time when that was the prevailing goal

648
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,839
of socialists in the 21st century I
don't think that's the case any longer

649
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,559
so I think this is a case where the
dictionary definition is out of date

650
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:14,400
it's not the job of socialists to stay
conformed to dictionary definitions it's

651
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,440
the job of definitions to describe
socialists as they exist in reality and

652
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,160
that can change over time to sum it up I
think the case for socialism can be

653
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,799
mainly understood as resting on the
following point in a society where

654
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,559
individuals are seen as ends in
themselves where individuals are able to

655
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:39,280
freely develop and pursue Ventures and
accumulate property as they see fit the

656
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,920
gifted the ambitious or the lucky can
exploit those who are less gifted

657
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,480
ambitious or lucky or perhaps outperform
them so dramatically that those Left

658
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,640
Behind understandably live lives marked
with shame the logic follows whether it

659
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,280
convinces you or not that a better
Society morally and perhaps economically

660
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,200
should have Protections in place to
mitigate that the business of sorting

661
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,480
out what those protections are or how
thorough they should be is much of the

662
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,359
substance of socialism and with that
thank you for watching

663
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,280
goodbye
